            <div class="textbox">This page consists of various images of my game in progress. As you can tell, my game is indeed far from finished, however this is what I have so far. You may notice some images are at night/dark and some are in the day. 
                This is because in the finished game, it shall be set in night to make the game scarier, more tense and enjoyable for the player. After all, whatâ€™s scarier than being trapped in a forest in pitch darkness with flesh eating zombies chasing you
                relentlessly? On the final image in the bottom right, you can see an area with two watchtowers guarding it. This shall be a fenced off facility that the player may only access once they have achieved a certain, undecided goal. On the top of this 
                facility shall be a helipad with a helicopter the player can escape with. They must fight their way through hordes of zombies, gain access to the facility, and fight their way to freedom!
